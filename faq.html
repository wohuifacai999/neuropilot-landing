                    <summary>How does NeuroPilot differ from other AI tools?</summary>
                    <p>NeuroPilot focuses on the end-to-end journey of building, from ideation and strategic planning to structured execution. Its key differentiators are the integrated Memory Engine for contextual continuity, the Goal Decomposer for breaking down complexity, and its design as a collaborative "AI Second Brain" rather than just a task-specific tool.</p>
